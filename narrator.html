    - [Instructor] Cards are typically displayed in a multi-card layout of some sort. In this challenge, you'll build on
    the
    card from the previous challenge by displaying multiple cards within the same layout. The layout can show at most
    three
    cards next to one another. When there is insufficient width available, the cards must wrap down to the next
    horizontal
    line and the position and layout of the wrapped row is entirely up to you. To test, change the viewport width to
    ensure
    the cards display properly and wrap as intended across all viewport widths. Also, try adding additional cards to see
    what happens. If we go over here and look at the preview, you can can see right now we have four cards that are
    already
    wrapping. If I reduce the width here, you can see the cards will automatically wrap down as necessary to always
    display
    the cards in the way that we want, without the cards ever getting too squished and without the cards ever taking up
    too
    much space. In the exercise files, you'll find I've just duplicated the card code that we had in the previous movie.
    So
    this is just four instances of the same card we already worked with. And the styles are exactly where I left them
    off in
    the previous movie. So everything right now matches what we had in the previous challenge. This is a responsive
    card.
    And as a result, if you go into the browser, you'll see it doesn't look the way we want. This isn't the layout we're
    looking for. We need to do something to change this layout and make it behave properly. This is your starting point.
    Now
    you take on this challenge. Pause the video here, find your solution, then come back, hit play and see how I solve
    the
    same challenge. The key to solving this challenge is to look back at some of the earlier challenges we had in this
    course. We're already laying out the main using flex. And that means that the cards are being displayed as equal
    height
    columns. However, they're not being displayed the way I want them. So I need to make some changes to the main first.
    Let's see here. So we have display flex and justify content center, that gives me a central line flex box. But I
    need to
    do a bit more to it. So first of all, I need to make it wrap. So I'll say flex wrap and wrap and let's look at that.
    Okay. So now all the boxes are just wrapping vertically. All right. That's not quite what I want, but okay. And then
    also you notice there's a lot of space between them. So what if we sit a gap. Let's see. Oh, the space is actually
    coming from down here on the card. So let's take that out first and then, hmm. Okay. Now they're jammed up against
    each
    other. So then we can use gap, cause gap is much easier to control. So we'll say gap 2rem. All right. So that gives
    us
    the cards in vertical stacks, which is not what we want. So we need to somehow change the display of each card so
    that
    they display next to one another. Here, it's important to remember, flex is a content out layout module, meaning the
    contents decide their own size. That means I need to change the size of the content down here in the card itself.
    Now,
    right now we're using this clamp for width. We're saying the card can be no smaller than 20ch. It should ideally be
    50%
    of the width. And the max width should be the content width, which is 50ch. So this is what's resulting in each of
    the
    cards being stacked vertically. And if we had a very large monitor, we would see them stacked next to one another,
    but
    that's highly unlikely. So we need to change this piece of code here. And here you have two very different options
    to
    choose from. We can either modify this code here to display differently or we can use flex basis to make this
    happen. So
    let's start by modifying this. So instead of saying clamp 20ch 50% of our content width, I want to say, let's see,
    if we
    take the total width and then divide it into four spaces that should give us three columns, because it's four plus
    the
    padding and everything. So that should give us three columns. So I'll say 20ch is still the smallest. And then I'll
    say
    calc and we'll grab we'll one quarter of a hundred percent. So one divided by four times 100%. And then for the max
    width, I actually want to set it to a hundred percent. So that's for the instances where we're displaying the card
    as
    its own instance. And that would be so that it takes up all the available space. So let's just try this and see what
    happens. So I'll go back to the browser. Oh, look at that. Now we have three cards, one next to the other. And I
    know
    when you look at this, it may sound a little surprising, because I have it divided by four here. But like I said,
    it's
    because we have four plus the padding, plus the some other stuff. And that's why we have this extra width. Now, this
    layout results in the cards all displaying next to one another. And the card that's being wrapped down below has the
    same width as the other cards, because we are defining the maximum width of the card. If you want it to be so that
    the
    card spans the full width, the wrapped card spans the full width and the cards are more dynamic and take up the
    available space, we can use flex basis to do that. We looked at that previously in the course and now we can just
    look
    at it again. So if we go down here and instead of saying width, I say flex and then grow one factor, shrink one
    factor,
    and then clamp, actually, I'm just going to copy that clamp entirely from up here. So we're using the same clamp
    like
    this. So here we're saying the flex basis, meaning the starting point for the calculation of the flex box is minimum
    20ch. Ideally something like a quarter of the total width and the maximum is a hundred percent. Let's save that and
    see
    what happens. So now we get a slightly different layout. So we have the three boxes at the top and you notice
    they're
    bigger than they were before. And if we scroll down, we have this giant box at the bottom. It also highlights a bit
    of a
    problem with my layout. I don't have any padding around this box here. So on the main, I'll just add padding 2rem so
    that we have space around. Okay? Then finally, we can go and inspect this. I'll dock this away so that you don't see
    it.
    And then we can check that this is responsive. So now you'll see that the boxes do resize, because we're using flex
    basis. So it's taking up all the available space and it is wrapping nicely. So those are two very different options
    that
    give you two very different results, but both solve the challenge. So here you can choose whichever works best with
    your
    particular layout needs.
