    (retro video game style music) - Full bleed sections, meaning the section takes up the full available width of the
    viewport can be used to provide visual separation between sections of an article, to highlight a specific section
    within
    an article, or to display large visuals like images or videos. In this challenge, you'll create two different full
    bleed
    sections, one for text, as you see here, and one for an image. The full bleed text section has a background color
    and
    the text is central line to line up with the rest of the text on the page. The full bleed image takes up the full
    available width as long as the image is wide enough. If the view port is wider than the image itself then the image
    should be central line. And finally to test, change the view port width to ensure the full bleed sections behave as
    expected, both in very narrow and very wide view ports. In the exercise files, you'll find a series of paragraphs
    and an
    image inside a figure. You'll also notice there's one section, a div with the full width class applied and a figure
    with
    a full width class applied. This full width class is what will create the full width view. I've also supplied some
    basic
    styling just to get you started, but if you go check in the browser you'll see right now is just a central line
    layout
    with no full width content of any kind. This is your starting point. Now is your turn to take on this challenge.
    Pause
    the video here, find your solution. Then come back, hit play and see how I solve the same challenge. (retro video
    game
    style music) When you see full width content your immediate thought is probably to somehow use 100 VW to make this
    content full width. Resist that urge. 100 VW doesn't behave nicely in all browsers and can cause unintended
    horizontal
    scrolling in some cases. A better solution is to use grid. Yes, I said grid. Let me show you what I mean. If you
    look at
    this layout right now and you were to draw this layout in a design application you would draw a grid. You would have
    a
    line here on the left hand side and a line here on the right hand side, and you would make three columns. An empty
    call
    is flexible on the left. Then a mid column with all the content that has some sort of definition of how wide it can
    be.
    And then an empty column on the right, that's also flexible. So let's build that exact grid in CSS. In my document,
    I
    can see that the main here is what contains all the elements, so I'll use the main class to start. So I'll take away
    all
    the styling so that it's no longer central line and I'll say display grid. Then I need to figure out how to lay out
    the
    grid, so here I'll set up three columns. The first column will be 1fr. The second column will be the content width,
    so I
    want it to be either the available width or a max width, so I'll use minmax for this column, minmax. And then I'll
    say
    it should either be auto, so whatever's the available width, or it'll be the content width, And I can see here, I
    already have a custom property for the content width so I'll just use that. So I'll say auto or var content width.
    And
    then finally the last column should be 1fr. That way we have a flexible column, a controlled width column for the
    content, and then a flexible column on the right hand side. Save that, go back in the browser, and this does not
    look
    what I want at all. I mean, we have three columns, but the content is being placed in those three columns. So what I
    need to do now is grab all the content within the grid and place it in the same column. I can do that down here. We
    already have a rule for main and then the first child or the first level children, so I'll just say for those items
    grid
    column two. So I'll place all direct descendants of the main in column number two. That brings us back to the
    original
    layout, which isn't what we want, so I need to do something else to make this work. So let's see, I have this class
    down
    here, it's called full width. So if I wanted to use full width to get the content to span across the entire grid, I
    would say grid column, and then from one to minus one, right. So let's do that and see what happens. Okay, so now
    the
    content is spanning the full width but the text content is also spanning the full width. And down here, the image
    has
    some padding on the left and right hand side. Okay, so what if I take the padding away, so I'll say padding and then
    2rem at the top but zero on the left and right hand side and save that. Okay, that made the text bunch all the way
    out
    but it did solve the problem for the image. Okay, so what do I do with this piece here? Well, I could just keep
    passing
    the grid down and say for the things that have full width, let's make another rule. So say full width and then the
    children of any class anything that has a class full width. So that is still the first descendant, remember. So
    here,
    we're saying the full width, this one and then any children should be aligned to the grid, so let's see. So if we
    say
    full width here then I can say grid column two. And that should be the same, right. I'll save that. Go back in the
    browser. That changed nothing. Why is that? Oh, it's because we're now inside a container and there's no grid here,
    so I
    need to copy the grid down. So what I can do here is say for the full width I want to use the same grid as the
    parent.
    So I'll say display grid, and then watch grid, template, columns inherit. So now I'm inheriting the grid into the
    full
    width, so that means I'm technically operating with two grids. I have the global grid and then I have a copy of the
    global grid inside this full width thing here. Now the image is, the text is aligned but it's not aligned properly,
    so I
    need to change that as well, I guess. So I'll go in here and say, so let's see full width here. And then the padding
    should be, let's see, full width and then say padding zero at the top, and then 2rem, text is aligned, okay. And the
    image is no longer full width right. So I also need to somehow deal with the image. So what I can do then is say, if
    we
    look at the markup, the image is sitting inside this figure and the figure is what's being set to full width. So if
    I
    look at this, let's see here, we have the figure, see the figure is full width. And then the image is in set, so I
    can
    do the same thing for the image as well. So if I say here, figure, and then the figure that has the class full
    width,
    just so that in case that we had other images that didn't have that, and then for that figure and the child, so that
    would be the image, say padding zero and grid column 1/ -1. So we're already inheriting the same grid up here,
    right.
    The full width grid. So I'm just setting the width of the image inside to 1/-1. So the full width and then the
    padding
    to zero, save that. Look at that. Image is now full width, text is now full width, and we have a complete solution.
    So
    yeah, 100 VW could probably solve your problem but it would introduce some unexpected behavior in some browsers.
    Whereas
    grid will give you complete control over exactly what's going on. And because we can inherit grid lines into other
    grids
    we can now get consistent layouts across the entire page.
