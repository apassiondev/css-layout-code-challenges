    - [Instructor] Card based layouts are popular for an obvious reason. Presenting information on cards makes it easy
    for
    the visitor to understand each card holds a separate piece of information. In the first of several card based
    challenges, you'll make a basic responsive card. The card features an image, a heading, a paragraph and a button.
    The
    image must appear at the top of the card edge to edge. The text and button should have consistent whitespace, top,
    right, bottom and left. The card must have a visible border or other design feature demarking its outer edges. The
    card
    must have a defined maximum width and be centered horizontally and vertically. And to test, change the viewport
    width to
    ensure the contents of the card are always displayed within the card at all possible widths. Looking in the browser
    here, I want to show you one specific feature with this card. As I reduce or increase the content width, you'll
    notice
    when we have a very wide viewport, the card doesn't change size. Then as I reduce the width of the viewport to a
    certain
    point, it starts reducing in size, but only to a specific point, at which place it stops reducing in size until we
    get
    even further down where the content is being squished. That's what I want you to achieve here. In the exercise
    files,
    you'll find the various pieces that make up the card in the HTML. There's also some basic styling, including empty
    rules
    for the relevant selectors. This is your starting point. Now you take on this challenge. Pause the video here, find
    your
    solution, then come back, hit play and see how I solve the same challenge. Out of the box, in the exercise files,
    there
    is no card at all. So the first thing we need to do is define the outer borders of the card. In the style sheet,
    there's
    this class here called card. And if we go look at the markup, you'll find here there's a figure with a class card
    and
    the figure wraps around everything. So in this particular markup, the figure is the card itself. So that's where we
    can
    start. Since we have a card, we need to demark the outer borders of the card. So I'll start by setting up a border.
    I'll
    set it to, let's see, 0.5rem and then solid and black, just so that we have a nice thick border. I also want to add
    some
    margin around the card so that it's not going edge to edge. So I'll say margin 2rem. This won't impact the card when
    it's a card in the middle of a large space, but it will impact the card when the card is in a very small space so
    that
    it never butts up against the sides. So let's just save this right now and go back and check. Okay, so we have a
    card,
    but it's way too big and it's not looking very nice. All right. So we need to do something else. What we can do here
    is
    limit the width of the card and I'll do that using the width property. And you notice I'm not using max width here
    because I want to use the clamp function. And the clamp function allows me to define the smallest size of the card,
    the
    desired size of the card, and the maximum size of the card. So here, I'll say for width, I'll say clamp, and then
    I'll
    say the smallest will be 20ch. The desired variable width will be 50% of the available space. And then for the
    widest
    width, I want to set the content width. So we've used the content width custom property before. It's the same thing.
    Only in this case, it's slightly smaller. So I'll say var and then content width. And that way, what we'll get is a
    layout where the card will try to be 50% of the width, except in cases where it would be smaller than 20ch, in which
    case it's 20ch. Or in cases where it can be, or in cases where 50% is bigger than the content width defined, in
    which
    case it'll just be the content width. All right, back in the browser, we now have a card. And if we open the
    inspector
    here and go to the mobile view, you see here I toggled the mobile so that I can use these toggles. If I resize the
    window, see it doesn't change size here. And then it slowly grows smaller and then eventually it'll grow smaller
    again.
    So now I'm getting the behavior I want, but the card isn't centered, so I need to fix that as well. For this
    particular
    instance, I can just do that in the main using the centered, using the center feature we talked about earlier in the
    course. I'll say display flex and justify content center. That will just center my card. Okay. Now we need to deal
    with
    the content inside. So let's look at the markup here. We have an image and then we have a fig caption. So that means
    I
    should be able to take the fig caption and then indent just the fig caption content. Right? So I'll grab just what's
    inside here and indent it. So I'll go down here, card fig caption. Okay. And then say margin zero and 2rem and 2rem.
    That will give us a nice margin, I think. Look at that, nicely aligned. And then I want this button here on the
    bottom
    to be over here on the right hand side. Now to do that, I could either do a text align, but I'm actually going to
    use
    flex for this. So here, I'll say for the card fig caption, I want to display it as flex. Then I want the flex
    direction
    to be column. And then for the, let's see, card button down here at the bottom, I'll say align self to flex end.
    Let's
    see what that looks like. Uh-huh, see. Now the button is over here. Now, the last thing I need to do is deal with
    this
    extra space that's here. So if I go look at the code, let's see, I'll dock this so you can see what's going on. So
    if I
    go look at the markup here, you'll see that h2 has a margin on the bottom. And then the paragraph has a margin at
    the
    top, but because this is now a flex box, those two margins aren't collapsing. So I need to remove one of those
    margins.
    I can choose to remove either. So in this example, I'll just remove the margin for card h2. So I'll say margin,
    woops,
    margin block end to zero. And now we don't have that giant wide space. That's it. That's the solution to the
    challenge.
    We now have a fully responsive card.
